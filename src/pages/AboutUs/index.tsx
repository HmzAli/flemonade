              <h2> Our Story </h2>
          
              <p>Our story begins in a humble home kitchen in Bangi, where Flemonade was born from a simple desire to create something pure and refreshing. We believe in keeping things real â€“ every bottle is crafted with genuine lemons and premium sugar, no artificial flavors, no shortcuts, no bullshit.</p>

              <p>Every batch is still made by hand because we believe that care can't be automated. Our small-batch approach lets us control every aspect of the process, from selecting the juiciest lemons to achieving that perfect balance of sweet and tart.</p>

              <p>We make Flemonade because we care about what goes into your glass. From our kitchen in Bangi to your table, we're committed to honest craftsmanship and genuine flavor.</p>
